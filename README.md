## 🧑‍💻 Projects  
### **Speech-to-Text & Sentiment Analysis**  
A real-time speech translation system developed with my team—Zahi, Osama Youssef, Basma, Maya, and Reem—supervised by **Marwan**. The project integrates **natural language processing** and **sentiment detection** for analyzing spoken language.

### **Image Classification with Kaggle Datasets**  
Using the **animal-image-classification-dataset** from Kaggle, I trained models to distinguish between multiple species. This involved image pre-processing, CNN architectures, and tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.
